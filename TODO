# Endpoint /run

Calling this endpoint (`POST`? `GET`? )should cause application to:

- [x] Send 30 POST requests to <https://httpbin.org/post>
  - [x] Each request should have JSON body in format {"value": N}, where N - randomly generated number in range od [0,10]
  - [x] Server should parse the responses and extract json.value from each JSON response.
- [x] It should calculate and return collection containing the numbers that appear more than once (most frequent numbers) in asc. order
- [x] If any request fails, server should log error, but continue procesing the remaining requests
- [x] Server should save each request into MySql database. Each stored request should have a unique identifier and generated value

Optional:

- [ ] REST-like CRUD API
  - [ ] should be implemented for managing the stored data in the MySql database.
  - [ ] API should include endpoints for creating, reading, updating, deleting records.
- [ ] User authentication
  - [ ] basic authentication system should be implemented, where users can auth with a username and password before using CRUD API
  - [ ] hardcoded values in DB are sufficient

Other Requirements:

- [ ] (partially DONE) add proper error hanlding for HTTP requests, db interactions, auth
- [ ] test suite for `/run` endpoint
- [ ] (Optional) test suite for authentication
- [ ] add docker support

Extra points for:

- clean, readable code
- performance of `/run` endpoint
- good practises, SOLID, DDD
- tests (unit + integration)

## Examples

[3, 2, 5, 1, 5, 7, 2, 1] -> [1, 2, 5]
[5, 7, 7] -> [7]
